0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
----------------------------------------------
For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.

Concepts Needed:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix Representation in Python:

1. Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
2. Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
In-place Operations:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
2. The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
Matrix Transposition:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
2. Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
Reversing Rows in a Matrix:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
Nested Loops:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
2. Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
1. Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
2. You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
